# hello-world
project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. 

Carlos is my name and the github is the game We are going to deploy the cloud to gain us some fame. If you think its lame then you can eat my dame for the fact that we will slaughter you and wont even stop to mame. Learning from the best to see what I can do I only want to trade this life for upgrading and dinner for two. Moms spaghetti is never ready but the sausage is for you.
